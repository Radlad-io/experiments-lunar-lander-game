        The event base architecture of javascript combined with the single
        threaded event loop creates a situation where a keyup event can
        occasionally fire before the keydown. This happens when holding a key
        and pressing and releasing other keys. This leads to a situation where
        keys can become suck in application state. The solution is to timestamp
        keydown and keyup events. This allows you to ignore key down event if
        they've occurred after the keyup even has already been fired.
